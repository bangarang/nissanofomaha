An AM/FM/CD audio system with six speakers will make your drive whether on or off road even more entertaining. Six airbags, vehicle dynamic control, a traction control system and a tire pressure monitoring system are all designed to keep you out of harm's way.

Want to stretch your purchasing power? Well take a look at this outstanding 2011 Honda Accord. New Car Test Drive called it "...big on efficiency, whether that means getting the most power and range from a gallon of gas, delivering the most interior space for the exterior dimensions or providing the smoothest, quietest ride and highest level of crash protection with the least weight..." Designated by Consumer Guide as a 2011 Recommended Midsize Car. Honda has made great strides in engine technology as perfectly illustrated by the 271hp 3.5-liter V6 in this Accord EX. Not only does it provide gobs of power, but gets better highway fuel economy than the 125hp 1990 Accord and even comes close to the tiny 68-hp 1977 edition.
