					<h2>"LEEDING" THE GREEN CHARGE</h2>
					<p>LEED, or Leadership in Energy & Environmental Design, is a third-party verification program for green buildings instituted by the U.S. Green Building Council. While designing the dealership in 2011 from the ground up, the decision to go for LEED certification was a no-brainer. As a result, we conserve energy, water, and other precious resources on a daily basis, and our building is, in general, healthier and safer for our customers and employees to be in.</p>

						<h2>(EVERYDAY) LIFE IN THE FAST LANE</h2>
						<p>At Nissan of Omaha, we help streamline the process of those simple, everyday tasks that can take time away from the more important things in life. Not only is it a cinch to get online and schedule your service appointment without picking up the phone, but the dealership is also equipped with an express service lane for oil changes and a fully automatic car wash. Nissan technicians are quick and efficient, so that next time your oil change indicator starts flashing, it wonâ€™t be such a drag.</p>
